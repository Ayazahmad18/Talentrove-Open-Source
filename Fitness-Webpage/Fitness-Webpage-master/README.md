# Fitness-Webpage
An home-webpage of a Fitness website with submission form.
A simulation of client side fitness website.

Follow the following steps to view the project:

Download the folder Css and images using clone or download option on the right of the repository. 
OR Create a folder in your laptop preferably on Desktop and then download the files inside the folder.

Once you are done with downloads please note that the names of files and images as well as 
the image folder must be same as the uploaded files in the repository since they have been used inside the codes with their paths.

Now you are all set to view the project. You can see, home, about and contact us buttons.

You will see an submission form in the front as you can see in the screenshot and also a submit button to save the information.

open "index.html" file with your browser(any). I will further attach the screenshots of the webpage in screenshots folder.
